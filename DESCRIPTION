Description: EQ-5D is a standard instrument (https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/) that measures the quality of life 
    often used in clinical and economic evaluations of health care technologies.Both adult versions of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L)
    contain a descriptive system and visual analog scale. The descriptive system measures the patient's health in 5 dimensions: 
    the 5L versions has 5 levels and 3L version has 3 levels. The descriptive system scores are usually converted to index values 
    using country specific values sets (that incorporates the country preferences). 
    The value sets for EQ-5D-3L based on Time Trade-Off (TTO) for 13 countires (Argentina, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom, USA) 
    or Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for 10 countries (Argentina, Belgium, Denmark, Europe, Finland, Germany, New Zealand, Slovenia, Spain,
    United Kingdom) are obtained from  Szende et al (2014) <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7596-1>.  For other countries the tariffs are obtianed 
    from the references mentioned in the  website https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-3l-about/valuation/. 
    The value sets for EQ-5D-5L for 14 countries (Canada, China,England, Germany, Hong Kong,Indonesia, Ireland,Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, and Uruguay) 
    are obtained from references mentioned in the https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about/valuation-standard-value-sets/.
    The value sets for Poland is obtained from Golicki et al <doi: 10.1007/s40273-019-00811-7>; value sets for Portugal is obtained from 
    Ferreira1 et al (2014) <doi:10.1007/s11136-019-02226-5>; and the value set for Taiwan is obtained from Lin et al (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209344>
